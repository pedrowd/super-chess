## About Ren'Py Chess Engine 2.0

Ren'Py Chess Engine 2.0 is a chess GUI built with the [Ren'Py](http://renpy.org/) Visual Novel Engine, [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess), and [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) (for chess AI). You can use it as a standalone playable or integrate it as a minigame into a Ren'Py visual novel project. Read the [guide for integration](https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/renpy-chess#guide-for-integrating-into-a-renpy-project) below.
